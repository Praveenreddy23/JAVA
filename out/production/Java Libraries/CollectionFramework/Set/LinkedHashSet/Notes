--@LinkedHashSet :
    ->LinkedHashSet is a class which extends HashSet.
    ->The LinkedHashSet is a child class of HashSet class it is implemented with
         a hybrid DS which is a combination of HashTable and LinkedList
         ->the HashTable Structure is used for unique storage of elements whereas
           LinkedList is used to preserve the order of insertion.
       ->Rest all the properties are same as HashSet.
--@Features of Linked Hash set :
        ➢ Size is dynamic.
        ➢ We can store heterogeneous type of data.
        ➢ It is not indexed type of data.
        ➢ It will not allow duplicates.
        ➢ It allows null.
        ➢ Since it is not indexed type of collection, we cannot do random access.
        ➢ It will follow order of insertion.
