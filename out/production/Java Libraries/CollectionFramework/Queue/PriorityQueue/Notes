2)Priority Queue:
  ->Priority queue is a class which implements queue interface which is of pure queue.
  ->It implements two marker interface 1)Serializable
                                       2)Cloneable
  ->Underlined DS of Queue is LinkedList Queue
  ->The Default capacity of priority queue is 11.
  ->It grows one node at a time.

 --@Features of Priority queue
    ➢ Size is dynamic.
    ➢ We can store heterogeneous type of data.
    ➢ It is not indexed.
    ➢ It allows duplicates.
    ➢ It is auto sorted.
    ➢ Since it is not indexed type of collection, we cannot fetch the elements uponindex.
    ➢ In priority queue to fetch the element we should use poll ( ) and peek ( ).

 -->Poll ( ) method
      ->Poll ( ) method is non – static member of the queue class , which helps to
        fetch the top most element of the queue and remove the element from the queue
        and reduce the size of the queue by 1.

 -->Peek ( ) method
      ->Peek ( ) method is non – static method of the priority queue class , which
        helps to fetch the top most element of the queue and it will not reduce the size of
        the queue by 1.
