#) String
--@ String:->
    --> String is a pre-defined final class present in a java.lang package.
    --> String Object are immutable in nature.
    --> String is a class as well as a datatype, therefore, refers String as non-primitive datatype.
    --> The default value of String  or any class type is null.
    --> String can be referred as a set of characters we should be enclosed with(" ") double quotes.

--@ String object can be created in two ways:->
    1) Without new Operator / literal Operator
            -->String s = "java";
    2) With new Operator
            -->String s = new String("java");

    --> String Object will get stored inside a memory location called as String pool.

--@ String pool further divided in to:->
    1)Constant pool.
    2)non-constant pool.

    -->String literal Object will get store inside constant pool, and constant pool doesn't allow duplicate.
    -->String Object created using new operator will get store inside non-constant pool, and
         non-constant pool allows duplicate.
