--@Custom ExceptionHandling.Exception or User-Defined ExceptionHandling.Exception:
 ->Based on the project,it is sometimes necessary to create our own ExceptionHandling.Exception and those exceptions
   which the user/programmer creates are called as custom ExceptionHandling.Exception or User-defined ExceptionHandling.Exception.
-->Rules for working with custom ExceptionHandling.Exception:
 1.Create a class with the ExceptionHandling.Exception name.
 2.The exception class which we created should either inherit ExceptionHandling.Exception(Checked) or RuntimeException(Unchecked) class.
 3.Create an object of the exception class and invoke/throw the object of that ExceptionHandling.Exception.
 4.Handle it using try and catch block.

--> throw keyword :
  ->throw is a keyword in order to invoke an object of exception.
  ->throw is generally used with custom exception.
  Syntax: throw objectOfExceptionType;
       // throw new ExceptionName();
