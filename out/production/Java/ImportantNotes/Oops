-->Object-oriented Programing:-
  ->Object --> instance of class.
  ->Class --> Blueprint of an Object.
  ->Encapsulation --> Protecting our Data.
  ->Polymorphism --> Different behaviour in different instances.
  ->Abstraction --> Hiding our irrelevant data.
  ->Inheritance --> One property of the object is acquiring another property of an object.
