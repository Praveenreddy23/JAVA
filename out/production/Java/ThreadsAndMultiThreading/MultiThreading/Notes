--@MultiThreading:-
  ->Two or more thread are accessing same object is called multiThreading.
  ->Or MultiThreading is a process to execute multiple threads at the same time
       without dependency of other threads called multithreading.
  ->If two or more threads accessing same object at the same time then it may lead
     for a problem called RACE condition.

  -Race Condition:-
    ->Multiple threads trying to access same object at same time is called as race cond.
    ->Race condition can be overcome by using Thread Synchronization.

  -->Thread Synchronization:-
    ->Thread Synchronization is executing threads in the sequential order,
      Where one thread will execute only after other thread completes the execution.

  -->Thread Synchronization can be achieved in 2 ways:-
    1)Using Synchronization method.
    2)Using Synchronization Blocks.

  1)Synchronized Method:-
  ->Any method which is declared by using synchronized keyword is called as Synchronized method.

  2)Synchronized Block:-
  ->Synchronized block will lock the given object until the thread complete its execution using the
    given object this prevents the other threads accessing the same object at the same time and hence
    race condition is avoided.

  ->Syntax:-
    Synchronized(Object_ref)
    {
        stmt..
        stmt..
        stmt..
    }
  ->Synchronized block are used to perform thread safe operations on those objects
    whose class is not thread safe.
