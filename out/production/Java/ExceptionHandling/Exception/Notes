Exception are of 2 types :
1. Compile Time Exception ( checked exception )
2. Run Time Exception ( unchecked exception )

 1.Compile Time Exception ( checked exception ) :
  ->Any exception which is caught by the compiler at the compile time , this is
    called compile time exception or checked exception.
   -> All the compile exceptions can be addressed by using try and catch or
    throws.
   -> Compile time exceptions should be addressed at the compile time itself.
   Ex:InterruptedException...FileNotFoundException...

  2. Run Time Exception ( unchecked ) :
   ->Any exception which is not caught(checked) at the compile time and found at
     the run time is called as run time exception or unchecked exception.
    -> Run time exceptions can be addressed by using try and catch or throws.
    ->All the Run time exceptions should be addressed at the Run time itself.
    Ex:ArithmeticException...ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException...
