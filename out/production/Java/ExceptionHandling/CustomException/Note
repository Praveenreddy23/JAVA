--@Custom Exception or User-Defined Exception:
 ->Based on the project,it is sometimes necessary to create our own Exception and those exceptions
   which the user/programmer creates are called as custom Exception or User-defined Exception.

-->Rules for working with custom Exception:
     1.Create a class with the Exception name.
     2.The exception class which we created should either inherit Exception(Checked) or RuntimeException(Unchecked) class.
     3.Create an object of the exception class and invoke/throw the object of that Exception.
     4.Handle it using try and catch block.
