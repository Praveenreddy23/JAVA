 --@Wrapper Class :
   -> All Wrapper Class are Pre-defined classes which belongs to java.lang package.
   --> The non-primitive version of a primitive datatype.
   -> All Wrapper class have overridden toString().
   ->For each and every primitive data type we have the corresponding class and
      those classes are called as wrapper class.
   ->We can perform an operation called AutoBoxing and AutoUnBoxing.

                 Primitive:                    Non-Primitive:(Default value:Null)

1)AutoBoxing:
  -> Converting from primitive date type to Wrapper class object is called as AutoBoxing.

2)AutoUnBoxing:
  -> Converting from Wrapper class object back to its primitive datatype is called as AutoUnBoxing.
