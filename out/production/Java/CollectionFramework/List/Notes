1)<<List>> :
 ->List is a pre-defined Interface present in java.util package.
 ->List was introduce from JDK1.2.
 ->The implementation class of List interface are as follows :
  1.ArrayList
  2.Vector
  3.Stack
  4.LinkedList

--@Specification of List Interface :
     1.Insertion order is maintain.
     2.Duplicates of object are allowed.
     3.Indexed based start from 0.
     4.null can be inserted.

--@Important method present in List Interface :
    1.get()- get() will return the object based on index position.
    2.indexOf()- indexOf() will find the index position of an object and first occurrence in case of duplication.
    3.lastIndexOf()- lastIndexOf() is used to find the last index position of an object.
    4.add(index,value)- is used to add an object based on the index position already existing object gets shifted to the next position.
    5.set(index,value)- is used to set an object based on the index position already existing object gets overridden.

 -->Object creation :
  List l = { new ArrayList();
             new LinkedList();
             new Vector();
             new Stack();
