    ->The initial capacity of ArrayList is 10.
    ->The incremental capacity of ArrayList is (current capacity*3/2)+1.
    ->The Underlined data stature from ArrayList is Resizeable Array / Growable Array.
    ->Sequential Memory Allocation.

--@Specification/Features of ArrayList Interface :
    1. Size is dynamic.
    2. We can store heterogeneous type of data.
    3. It is indexed type of collection.
    4. It allows duplicates.
    5. It allows null.
    6. It will follow order of insertion.
    7. Since it is indexed type of collection we can do random access.
    8. It will grow its size by 50 %.
    9. It is not synchronized.(Not Thread Safe)
    10.Since it is not synchronized, the performance is fast.
