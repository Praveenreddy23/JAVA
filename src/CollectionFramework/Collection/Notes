--@Collection Framework :

-@Data Structure :
  ->Data Structure is a way of storing or organizing the data.
  ->Data Structure is the arrangement of a group of object.
   Eg:-> Stack,Queue,Array,LinkedList,Tree,HashTable......

-@Collection :
  ->Collection is a pre-defined interface present in java.util package.
  ->Collection is a container used to store a group of object.
  ->Collection is introduce from JDK 1.2.

-@Collections :
  ->Collections is a pre-defined Class present in java.util package.
  ->it has inbuilt methods like sort , search.

     Collections (c)
    -> Sort ( )
    -> Binary search(

--@ Difference between Array and Collection :
          Array                                  Collection
  1.Homogeneous in nature.              1.Homogeneous and Heterogeneous
  2.Fixed Size.                         2.Dynamic Size.
  3.Does not have any methods.          3.Many pre-defined methods.
  4.Does not support Generics.          4.Generics supported.


--@Pre-defined method in Collection Interface :
  1. add() - add() will add an object into the collection
  2. addAll()-addAll() will add one collection into another collection
  3. remove()-remove() will remove an object from the collection based on index
  4. removeAll()-removeAll() will remove one collection from another collection
  5. contains()-contains() checks if the object is present in the collection or not
  6. containsAll()-containsAll() will check if one collection is present in another collection or not
  7. isEmpty()-isEmpty() will check if the collection is empty or not
  8. clear()-clear() will remove all the objects present in the collection
  9. size()-size() is used to count the number of object present in the collection
  10. iterator()-iterator() is used to traverse a group of object.
       Syntax :public Iterator<E> iterator();


--@Collection Hierarchy :
                                   <<Iterable>>
                                        |
                                  <<Collection>>
        1)  <<List>>                 2)  <<Queue>>                   3) <<Set>>
       ArrayList   Vector  LinkedList     PriorityQueue    HashSet      <<SortedSet>>
                    Stack                               LinkedHashSet     <<NavigableSet>>
                                                                             TreeSet

1)<<List>> :
 ->List is a pre-defined Interface present in java.util package.
 ->List was introduce from JDK1.2.
 ->The implementation class of List interface are as follows :
  1.ArrayList
  2.Vector
  3.Stack
  4.LinkedList

--@Specification of List Interface :
     1.Insertion order is maintain.
     2.Duplicates of object are allowed.
     3.Indexed based start from 0.
     4.null can be inserted.

--@Important method present in List Interface :
    1.get()- get() will return the object based on index position.
    2.indexOf()- indexOf() will find the index position of an object and first occurrence in case of duplication.
    3.lastIndexOf()- lastIndexOf() is used to find the last index position of an object.
    4.add(index,value)- is used to add an object based on the index position already existing object gets shifted to the next position.
    5.set(index,value)- is used to set an object based on the index position already existing object gets overridden.

 -->Object creation :
  List l = { new ArrayList();
             new LinkedList();
             new Vector();
             new Stack();

1)ArrayList :
    -> ArrayList is a pre-defined class present in java.util package.
    ->The initial capacity of ArrayList is 10.
    ->The incremental capacity of ArrayList is (current capacity*3/2)+1.
    ->The Underlined data stature from ArrayList is Resizeable Array / Growable Array.
    ->Sequential Memory Allocation.
    ->Contains 3 Constructors.

2.LinkedList:
   -> ArrayList is a pre-defined class present in java.util package.
   -> The Underlined Data structure doubly LinkedList.
   -> Non-sequential Memory Allocation.
   -> LinkedList Has 2 Constructors.

    --@When you will go for linked list type of collection ?
       ->Whenever we want proper order of insertion , then we should go for linked list.
       ->Linked list is a class which have dual property
