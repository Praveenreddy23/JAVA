--@TreeSet :
      ->TreeSet is a implementation class of SortedSet.
      ->Underlined DS is Binary Tree.
      ->Traversing Order LeftNodeParentNodeRightNode
      ->The elements in the TreeSet are arranged in the Natural Sorting order (Ascending order).
      ->TreeSet doesn't allow NULL insertion.
      ->If NULL is a first element of the TreeSet , then it allows but that
        treeset will not allow another element.it throws NULLPOINTEREXCEPTION.
      ->All the elements of the tree set must be of same type bcz the tree set
        sorts the elements and stores it in the TreeStructure.
      ->We can add only the Object which are comparable type to the tree set
        otherwise the treeset throws CLASSCASTEXCEPTION.

--@ Features of Tree Hash set:
   ➢ Size is dynamic
   ➢ We can store homogeneous type of data.
   ➢ It is not indexed type of data.
   ➢ It will not allow duplicates.
   ➢ It allows null.
   ➢ Since it is not indexed type of collection, we cannot do random access.
   ➢ It is complexity auto sorted.
