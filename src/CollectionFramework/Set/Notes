2)<<Set>> :
  ->Set is a pre-defined Interface present in java.util package.
  ->Set  was introduce from JDK1.2.
  ->A Set is a type of collection which is used to store only unique elements.
  ->Set Doesn't  allows duplicate elements
  ->Elements are stored without index.
  ->Null insertion is allowed.(Only one null is allowed Since duplicate is not allowed in set)
  ->Set elements can be retrieved by using Iterator bcz there is no specific methods to access the set.
  ->The implementation class of Set Interface are:
    1.HashSet
    2.LinkedHashSet
    3.TreeSet
 -->HashSet has a child class or Subclass known as LinkedHashSet.
 -->HashSet stores unique element but doesn't preserve order of insertion.
 -->LinkedHashSet is a type of HashSet which preserve order of insertion.
 -->TreeSet is a type of SortedSet Where the elements are stored in a Sorted Order (Ascending Order).

--@Object Creation:
Set s = { new HashSet
          new LinkedHashSet
          new TreeSet

 --@ When do we go for set type of collection ?
    --> Whenever we want to store the element not upon index and not allowing
        duplicates, then we should go for set type of collection.
