--@Vector List:
 ->Vector is a pre-defined class present in java.util package.
 ->Vector List is a class which Implements List Interface.
 ->It is Legacy Collection (Very Old)
 ->Vector is a Implementation class of ListInterface.
 ->The Vector is Implemented Using ReSizable/Growable Array DataStructure.
 ->The default capacity of vector is 10.
 ->The Incremental capacity of Vector is  (currentCapacity*2).

--@Features of vector list:
    ➢ Size is dynamic.
    ➢ We can store heterogeneous type of data.
    ➢ It is indexed type of collection.
    ➢ It allows duplicates.
    ➢ It allows null.
    ➢ It will follow order of insertion.
    ➢ Since it is indexed type of collection we can do random access.
    ➢ It will grow its size by 100 %.
    ➢ It is synchronized.(Thread safe).
    ➢ Since it is synchronized, the performance is slow.

--@Difference Between ArrayList and Vector:
            ArrayList:                   Vector:
           1.JDK 1.2                    1.JDK 1.0
           2.IC = (CC*3)/2 +1           2.IC = CC*2
           3.3 Constructors             3.4 Constructors
           4.Not Thread Safe            4.Thread Safe (Synchronized)
