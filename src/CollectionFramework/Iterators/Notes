--@Iterators:
  -->‘Iterator’ is an interface Present in java.util package which belongs to collection framework.
  -->A java cursor is an iterator, which is used to iterate or traverse or retrieve a
      a collection or Stream Objects elements one by one.

  -->There are three cursors in java:
    1.Iterator     JDK 1.0
    2.Enumeration  JDK 1.2
    3.ListIterator JDK 1.2

   1)Iterator:
    ->Iterators in Java are used in the Collection framework to retrieve elements one by one.
    ->It is a universal iterator as we can apply it to any Collection object.
    ->By using Iterator, we can perform both read and remove operations.
    ->Iterator must be used whenever we want to enumerate elements in
       all Collection framework implemented interfaces like,
        Set, List, Queue, Deque, and all implemented classes of Map interface.
    ->Iterator is the only cursor available for the entire collection framework.
    ->Iterator object can be created by calling iterator() method present in Collection interface.

  -@ Syntax:
      Iterator itr = c.iterator();
       ->Here “c” is any Collection object.
       ->itr is of type Iterator interface and refers to “c”.

 --@Methods of Iterator Interface in Java:
   1. hasNext(): Returns true if the iteration has more elements.
   --@Syntax:
          public boolean hasNext();

   2. next(): Returns the next element in the iteration. It throws NoSuchElementException if no more element is present.
   --@Syntax:
          public Object next();

   3. remove(): Removes the next element in the iteration. This method can be called only once per call to next().
   --@Syntax:
          public void remove();

       -->Note: remove() method can throw two exceptions namely as follows:
          -> UnsupportedOperationException : If the remove operation is not supported by this iterator.
          -> IllegalStateException : If the next method has not yet been called, or
                                     the remove method has already been called after the last call to the next method.



 2)ListIterator:
 ->‘ListIterator’ in Java is an Iterator which allows users to traverse Collection in both direction.
 ->ListIterator object can be created by calling listIterator() method present in the List interface.

 --@Syntax:
      ListIterator itr = l.listIterator();

  ->It contains the following methods:
      ->void add(Object object):
        ->It inserts object immediately before the element that is returned by the next( ) function.

      ->boolean hasNext( ):
        ->It returns true if the list has a next element.

      ->boolean hasPrevious( ):
        ->It returns true if the list has a previous element.

      ->Object next( ):
        ->It returns the next element of the list. It throws ‘NoSuchElementException’ if there is no next element in the list.

      ->Object previous( ):
        ->It returns the previous element of the list. It throws ‘NoSuchElementException’ if there is no previous element.

      ->void remove( ):
        ->It removes the current element from the list. It throws ‘IllegalStateException’ if this function is called before next( ) or previous( ) is invoked.
