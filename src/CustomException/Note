--@Custom Exception or User-Defined Exception:
 ->Based on the project,it is sometimes necessary to create our own Exception and those exceptions
   which the user/programmer creates are called as custom Exception or User-defined Exception.
-->Rules for working with custom Exception:
 1.Create a class with the Exception name.
 2.The exception class which we created should either inherit Exception(Checked) or RuntimeException(Unchecked) class.
 3.Create an object of the exception class and invoke/throw the object of that Exception.
 4.Handle it using try and catch block.

--> throw keyword :
  ->throw is a keyword in order to invoke an object of exception.
  ->throw is generally used with custom exception.
  Syntax: throw objectOfExceptionType;
       // throw new ExceptionName();
