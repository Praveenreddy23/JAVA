--@Methods in multithreading:
 1)Sleep() Method:-
   ->Sleep is a static method of thread class .
   ->Sleep method to put a thread into temporary waiting state.
   ->Sleep methods throws checked exception That is, InterruptedException.

  ->Syntax:
     Thread.Sleep(1000);->milli seconds
     or
     Thread t = new Thread();
     t.sleep(1000);

 2)join() Method:
   ->The main purpose of join method is to put the thread into temporary waiting state.
   ->If we want to execute complete any particular thread among all the threads available in the thread pool.
   ->Join method also throws checked exception That is, InterruptedException.

 3)Suspend():-
   ->The suspend method is to put thread from running state to waiting state.
     Ex:
        t.start();->Execute
        t1.start();->Not Execute
        t2.start();->Execute

        t1.suspend();

 4)Resume():-
   ->Resume method is used to resume a suspended thread from waiting state to runnable state.
      Ex:
         t1.resume();

 5)yield():-
   ->yield is a method of thread class that allow us to run another thread which has
     same priority by passes its current thread.

     Ex:
       t.start();->Execute
       t1.start();->Stop
       t2.start();->Execute

       t1.yield();

 6)Stop():-
   ->Stop is a method of thread class which is used to terminate a thread permanently.
    Ex:
      t.start();
      t1.start();//t1.stop();
      t2.start();

 7)isAlive():-
   ->isAlive() is a pre-defined method of thread class through which we can
      verify weather a thread isAlive or Not.
   Note: ->If thread isAlive then it will return true otherwise false.
         ->If we use isAlive method before the start method then it will print
           false but after the start method it will print true.

 8)interrupt():-
   ->interrupt() is a pre-defined method of thread class that is used to interrupt the thread.
   Note:->if any thread is in sleeping or blocked state then we can easily
           interrupt the execution of thread by throwing interruptedException.
        ->If thread not on sleeping or waiting state then thread execute normally.

 --@What is thread priority:
   ->It is possible to assign the priority of thread.
   ->java thread class has provided two pre-defined methods:
     1)setPriority()
     2)getPriority()
   ->The thread class has also provided three pe-defined final static variable and
      its value lie between 1 to 10;
     1)Thread.MIN_PRIORITY -->1
     2)Thread.NORM_PRIORITY -->5
     3)Thread.MAX_PRIORITY -->10

   1)setPriority()->
