--@Thread:
  ->Thread is a pre-defined class which is present in java.lang package.
  ->Thread is a basic unit of CPU and it is well known for independent execution.

  ->threads are used for performing Multitasking in programs/Applications.
  ->Whenever JVM starts the execution it creates 3 Thread byDefault:-
      1)Main Thread
      2)Garbage Collector
      3)Thread Scheduler

  ->By-default all the programs in java will be executed in Main thread.

 -->In java Thread can be created in 2ways:-
     1)By extending Thread Class.
     2)By Implementing Runnable Interface.

  1)By extending Thread Class:-
   ->step-1: Create a class that extends Thread class.
   ->step-2: Override run() to define the task that should be executed by the thread.
           ->Start the thread execution
   ->step-3: Create the object of subclass.
   ->step-4: use the subclass object to call start() of thread class.

  2)By implementing Runnable interface:-
   ->step-1: Create a class that implements Runnable interface.
   ->step-2: Override run() to define task that should be executed by the thread.
          ->Start the thread execution
   ->step-3: create Object of implementation Class
   ->step-4: Create Object of thread class and pass the implementation class object reference to thread constructor.
   ->step-5: Use the thread class object to call start() of thread class.

  Note:- If the class is already extends from some other super class, then it is not possible to extends thread class
         as it lead multiple inheritance and hence thread task is define by implementing Runnable interface.

 -->Thread Scheduler:-
    ->Thread Scheduler is the part of JVM which executes multiple threads on a single processor randomly.
