-->throw keyword :
   ->Used to throw an object of Throwable type.
    -> throw keyword is used to throw the exception explicitly by the
        programmer according to the application requirements
    ->throw is a keyword in order to invoke an object of exception.
    ->throw is generally used with custom exception.
        Syntax: throw e;
                e --> an Object of throwable type
             Ex:
                1)throw new ArithmeticException();
                2)ArithmeticException e1 = new ArithmeticException();
                    throw e1;
                3)throw new String()--> Error bcz String is not a type of throwable
             // throw new ExceptionName();

-->Rules
    1)Can throw only throwable type object.
    2)Only onr object can thrown.
    3)Must be used in Method body or Constructor body.


-->throws keyword :
    -> throws keyword is used to propagate checked exceptions explicitly
       by the programmer.
    ->throws is a indication to the caller about the possibility of an exception.
    ->throws is used to propagate an exception.
    ->throws is generally used with checked exception.
    ->typically we use throws with methods, and we can use
      throws wrt constructor as well.

 --@Difference b/w throw and throws
    THROW
    1. Throw is used to throw the instance of throwable type.
    2. Throw should be always developed in method body.
    3. Throw is used to create the exception.
    4. Throw can throw only 1 object at a time.
    THROWS
    1. Throws is used to propagate the exception from 1 method to the called method.
    2. Throws should be developed in method declaration.
    3. Throws is used to propagate the exception.
