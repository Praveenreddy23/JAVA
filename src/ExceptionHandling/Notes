-->ERROR:
   ->Error is a Runtime interruption which cannot be handled(We have to Debug)
       -Errors are of 2types
         1.compilation error -> Syntax Mistake
         2.Runtime Error -> Execute a class without main()

-->Exception Handling:
   ->Exception is a event or an interruption which stops the execution of a program.
       (Below lines of code not get executed)
   ->Exception is also a Runtime interruption which can be handled.
   ->The process of handling an Exception is called as Exception handling.
   ->Exception is handled using Try block and Catch block.

 -->Try and Catch block:
  ->The critical lines of code which gives an exception should be written inside the try block.
  ->If there is try block, mandatorily catch block should be present.
  ->The Solution should always be written the catch block.
  ->Catch block will be executed only if an exception occurs.
   Syntax :
   try
   {
      //set of instructions
   }
   catch(ExceptionName referenceVariable)
   {
     //set of instructions
   }
 ->One try block can have any number of catch blocks.
 ->There should not be any executable lines of code between try and catch block.
 ->It is always a good practice to handle the superclass exception as the last catch block.
    Ex:
       try{
       System.out.println(10/0);
       }
       catch(Exception e)
       {
        System.out.println("Super Class Exception Handler");
       }
