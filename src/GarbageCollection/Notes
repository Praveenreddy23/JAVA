--@Garbage Collection:
  ->Means unreferenced Object.
  ->It is a way to destroy the unused Object.
  ->It is the process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically.

-->Advantages:
   ->Makes Memory Efficient
   ->Automatically done

 -@What is the meaning of unreferenced Object?
   1)By nulling the reference
     Demo a = new Demo();
       a = null;
   2)By assigning reference to another
     Demo a = new Demo();
     Demo b = new Demo();
        a = b;
   3)By anonymous Object
       new Demo();

 --@Methods:
  1)finalize():-
      ->Just before destroying any object, the garbage collector always calls finalize()
         method to perform clean-up activities on that object. This process is known as Finalization in Java.
  2)gc():-
      ->It is used to invoke the  garbage collector to perform cleanup processing.
      ->The gc() found in System and Runtime classes.
      ->It is static method which is used to call finalize before destroying the object.
