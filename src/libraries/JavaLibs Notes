#Java libraries
 -->java libraries is a collection of pre-defined packages.
 -->Each package as a collection of class and interface.
 -->Each class and interfaces as a collection of variable and methods

 *All the pre-defined packages are present in a zip file called as src.zip

# A few pre-defined packages are as follows:
    1.java.lang
    2.java.util
    3.java.io
    4.java.sql
    5.java.net
    6.java.math
    7.java.applet
    8.java.awt   etc....

Notes:

 8.public void Wait(long a int b)
 9.public class getclass()
