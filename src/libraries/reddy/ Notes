#Java libraries
 -->java libraries is a collection of pre-defined packages.
 -->Each package as a collection of class and interface.
 -->Each class and interfaces as a collection of variable and methods

 *All the pre-defined packages are present in a zip file called as src.zip

# A few pre-defined packages are as follows:
    1.java.lang
    2.java.util
    3.java.io
    4.java.sql
    5.java.net
    6.java.math
    7.java.applet
    8.java.awt   etc....

Notes:
    java.lang-->Object,String,System,thread,<<comparable>>
    java.util-->Scanner,ArrayList,HashSet,<<collection>>
    java.io-->file,filereader,fileWriter

1.Java.lang package:
 ->java.lang package is attometically imported in all class and interface.

*Object:
 ->Object is a pre-defined class present in java.lang package.
 ->Object is the supermost class in entire java. because every class in java will implicitly inheriter Object class.

Example:
  class pen(extends Object)
  {
    Object obj = new pen();
  }

#importent methods are present in Object class:
 1.public String toString()
 2.public int hashCode()
 3.public boolean equals(Object obj)
 4.public void notify()
 5.public void notifyAll()
 6.public void Wait()
 7.public void Wait(long a)
 8.public void Wait(long a int b)
 9.public class getclass()
 10.protected object clone()
 11.protected void finalize()
