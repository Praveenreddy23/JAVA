#) String
--@ String:->
    --> String is a pre-defined final class present in a java.lang package.
    --> String Object are immutable in nature.
    --> String is a class as well as a datatype, therefore, refers String as non-primitive datatype.
    --> The default value of String  or any class type is null.
    --> String can be referred as a set of characters we should be enclosed with(" ") double quotes.

--@ String object can be created in two ways:->
    1) Without new Operator / literal Operator
            -->String s = "java";
    2) With new Operator
            -->String s = new String("java");

    --> String Object will get stored inside a memory location called as String pool.

--@ String pool further divided in to:->
    1)Constant pool.
    2)non-constant pool.

    -->String literal Object will get store inside constant pool, and constant pool doesn't allow duplicate.
    -->String Object created using new operator will get store inside non-constant pool, and
         non-constant pool allows duplicate.

--@ How String Object are immutable in nature:->
    or
--@ Explain String immutability Concept:->
   -> When we reinitialize a String object, the existing object not modified,rather than
      that a new Object get created and the reference variable pointing to the old object gets de-referenced
      and start pointing to the newly created object. therefore String Object are immutable in nature

--@ Advantage:-> If 2 ref. variables are pointing same string object
               then changes done on the object through one reference
                variable will not effect another reference variable.

--@ Disadvantage:-> If you reinitialize same reference variable for n number
                     of times then it will result in creation of multiple
                     de-referenced objects which will occupy the memory space
                     and may lead to OutofMemoryError.

--@To overcome the disadvantage of immutable property java developers
   created two new classes
   1) StringBuffer
   2) StringBuilder
